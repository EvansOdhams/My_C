C Programming Examples
This repository contains examples of C programs that demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

Installation
To run the programs in this repository, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. We recommend using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is available on most operating systems.

If you're using Linux, you can install GCC using your distribution's package manager. On Ubuntu, for example, you can run the following command:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install gcc
If you're using Windows, you can download GCC from the MinGW website: http://www.mingw.org/

Usage
To compile a C program, navigate to the directory containing the program and run the following command:

Copy code
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
This will compile the program and create an executable file called program_name.

To run the program, simply type its name followed by any command line arguments:

bash
Copy code
./program_name argument1 argument2 ...
Program Examples
This repository includes several example programs, organized by topic:

Basic Syntax: Examples of basic C syntax and program structure.
Data Types: Examples of working with different data types in C.
Control Structures: Examples of conditional statements and loops.
Functions: Examples of writing and calling functions in C.
Pointers: Examples of using pointers to manipulate memory addresses.
Each program is contained in its own directory and includes a README file with instructions for how to compile and run the program.
